# AG-replication-code
This code replicates Aguiar and Gopinath (2006) in julia. We solve the model with the same approach followed by the authors: state space discretization 
and value function iteration on a detrended version of the model. Please see the technical appendix of Aguiar and Gopinath (2006) for details.
The original code from the authors is available here https://scholar.harvard.edu/gopinath/publications/defaultable-debt-interest-rates-and-current-account.
